== Bio
I am a lecturer in computer science at [http://qmul.ac.uk/ Queen Mary, University of London].

I finished my doctorate at [http://www.labri.fr/ Laboratoire Bordelais de Recherche en Informatique] under the supervision of [https://www.labri.fr/perso/gimbert/ Hugo Gimbert]. Afterwards, I was a postdoc with [https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~bojan/ Mikołaj Bojańczyk] in [http://www.mimuw.edu.pl/ Warsaw], and later with [https://people.mpi-sws.org/~joel/ Joël Ouaknine] and [https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/james.worrell/home.html James Worrell] at [https://cs.ox.ac.uk/ Oxford] and [http://mpi-sws.org/ MPI].
