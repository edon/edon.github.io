<h1>Undoing Rotations</h1>
</div>
<p><a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/eecs/people/profiles/huraymond.html" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Ray</a> told me about an interesting <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2499647-mathematicians-have-found-a-hidden-reset-button-for-undoing-rotation/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>new scientist article</a> titled &ldquo;Mathematicians have found a hidden 'reset button&rsquo; for undoing rotation&rdquo;. It popularises <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/xk8y-hycn" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>this article</a> by Jean-Pierre Eckmann and Tsvi Tlusty published in the Physical Review Letters last month. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14367" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Here</a> is the arxiv version. I'll explain here what the results of the paper are, and I give a different proof for a weaker theorem. 
</p>
<h2>What is it about?</h2>
<p>It is about sequences of rotations in 3-dimensional euclidian space. One describes such a rotation \(R\) using two pieces of information:
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[
\underbrace{\theta}_{\text{angle}}\qquad\qquad\qquad\underbrace{A}_{\text{axis of rotation}}
\]
</p><p>Composition of a sequence \(R_1,\ldots, R_k\) of rotations is again a rotation. This is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_rotation_theorem" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Euler's rotation theorem</a>, and shows that rotations have a group structure.
</p>
<p><font color=grey size=3>
(One can also see rotations as orthogonal matrices with determinant \(+1\). Orthogonal here means that \(MM^T=I\). The group of these matrices is called the special orthogonal group and is denoted by \(SO(3)\). Its matrices have an eigenvalue \(e^{\theta2\pi\mathbf{i}}\), its complex conjugate, and \(1\). The eigenspace of \(1\) is the axis of rotation, while \(\theta\) is the angle. Composing rotations is just matrix multiplication. )
</p>
<p></font>
The article poses the question: given a sequence of rotations
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[
  (\theta_1,A_1), (\theta_2, A_2), \ldots, (\theta_k, A_k)
  \]
</p><p>is it possible to scale the angles such that the composition is equal to the identity. In other words, does there exist a real \(\lambda&gt;0\) such that composing
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[
  (\lambda\theta_1,A_1), (\lambda\theta_2, A_2), \ldots, (\lambda\theta_k, A_k)
  \]
</p><p>yields the identity rotation, namely rotation by angle \(0\).
</p>
<p>In the article the authors demonstrate that such a scaling exists <i>rarely</i>. Indeed, the existence of such \(\lambda&gt;0\) implies that
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[
  \frac {\theta_i}{\theta_j} \in \mathbb Q. 
  \]
</p><p>However - and this is the interesting phenomenon - if the sequence of rotations is done twice, such scaling can almost always be found. In other words, the question of whether there exists a \(\lambda&gt;0\) such that
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[
  (\lambda\theta_1,A_1), (\lambda\theta_2, A_2), \ldots, (\lambda\theta_k, A_k), (\lambda\theta_1,A_1), (\lambda\theta_2, A_2), \ldots, (\lambda\theta_k, A_k)
  \]
</p><p>is the identity rotation, almost always has a positive answer. More precisely
</p>
<p><b>Theorem.</b> (Eckmann, Tlusty 2025) Unless for every \(i\) there exists a \(j\ne i\) such that
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[
  \theta_i = \theta_j,
  \]
</p><p>there always exists a \(\lambda&gt;0\) such that the sequence of rotations above, performed twice, equals the identity rotation.
</p>
<h2>Another proof of a weaker theorem</h2>
<p>The proof of the theorem above uses geometry of numbers. There very well may be an elementary proof, but I will provide one that uses diophantine approximations (indirectly also geometry of numbers) for a weaker theorem. On the positive side, it is rather short and illustrative. I have not put any effort in finding an elementary proof.
</p>
<p><b>Theorem.</b> Assume that there is some \(\theta_i\) which cannot be written as a \(\mathbb Q\)-linear combination of \(\theta_j\), \(j\ne i\). Then there exists \(\lambda&gt;0\) that makes the sequence of rotations above done twice, equal to the identity rotation.
</p>
<p><b>Proof.</b>
</p>
<p>Let the composition of
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[
    (\lambda\theta_1,A_1), (\lambda\theta_2, A_2), \ldots, (\lambda\theta_k, A_k),
  \]
</p><p>be the rotation
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[
  (\theta, A). 
  \]
</p><p>Define the function \(F\ :\ \mathbb R_+\to [0, 2\pi)\) which maps
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[
  \lambda\mapsto \theta. 
  \]
</p><p>So \(F\) is mapping the scaling factor \(\lambda\) to the resulting angle of rotation \(\theta\). To prove the theorem it suffices to show that there is some \(\lambda^*\in\mathbb R_+\) such that \(F(\lambda^*)=\pi\), (or 0), meaning that scaling by \(\lambda^*\) we end up doing a rotation with angle \(\pi\), doing this rotation twice results in the identity. Since \(F\) is a continuous function, by the intermediate value theorem, if there are \(\lambda_1,\lambda_2\), such that
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[
  F(\lambda_1) \le \pi \le F(\lambda_2),
  \]
</p><p>then either for some \(\lambda^*\) we have \(F(\lambda^*)=\pi\), or \(F(\lambda^*)=0\), in either case performing this rotation twice leads to the identity rotation and proves the theorem. 
</p>
<p>We will now show the existence of such \(\lambda_1,\lambda_2\). To this end, let
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[
  \{\phi_1,\ldots, \phi_l\}\subseteq \{\theta_1,\ldots, \theta_k\},
  \]
</p><p>be a maximal \(\mathbb Q\)-linearly independent subset. Note that \(\theta_i\) in the assumption of the theorem belongs to this subset, and that \(l\ge 2\). Assume without loss of generality that \(\phi_1 = \theta_i\). Here we apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker%27s_theorem" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Kronecker's theorem on simultaneous diophantine approximation</a> (we probably need something much weaker) which says that if \(\phi_1,\ldots, \phi_l\) are \(\mathbb Q\)-linearly independent then the set of values
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[
  \left\{\left(n\phi_1\ \mathrm{mod}\  2\pi, \ldots, n\phi_l\ \mathrm{mod}\  2\pi\right)\ :\ n\in\mathbb N\right\}
  \]
</p><p>is dense in \([0,2\pi)^l\). As a consequence, for any given \(x\in [0,2\pi)\), and \(\epsilon&gt;0\), there exists some \(\lambda&gt;0\) such that
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[
  \left(\lambda\phi_1\ \mathrm{mod}\  2\pi, \ldots, \lambda\phi_l\ \mathrm{mod}\  2\pi\right)
  \]
</p><p>is in the \(\epsilon\)-ball of \((x,0,\ldots,0)\). Since when the independent variables \(\lambda\phi_2,\ldots, \lambda\phi_l\) are close to 0, so are the dependent ones \(\lambda\theta_j\), it follows that the resulting angle of rotation, when angles are scaled by \(\lambda\), is close to \(x\). Since \(x\) was arbitrary the existence of \(\lambda_1\), \(\lambda_2\) above is proved, and with it the theorem.
